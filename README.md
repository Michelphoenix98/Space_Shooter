# Space_Shooter
My own version of space invaders written using java to ease my boredom during CS practical lab sessions.
I wrote the entire program with no notion of actual game programming but with a curiosity to learn animations and special effects.
The game is complete with Cheat Codes, Consecutive Damage Protection, Shields ,Heads-Up Display, Power-Ups, Boss levels and different classes of enemies and weapons.
